# MMAB-Imageboard

A simple imageboard/forum, with a focus on user privacy. Created by 2 Australians.

Currently this project is hosted on github without the more sensitive parts that are less safe for public consumption, or have sensitive data.
It is being updated hourly, but this will probably change as updates to the code get less and less regular.

The system has a focus on mobile displays, but as all small-time personal projects, it may have some problems. That said, the system is simple enough to be easily changed for any possible display requirements, we've just kept it basic right now.

If you somehow stumble upon this repo and are interested, send me an email, I'll try to get back to you.
